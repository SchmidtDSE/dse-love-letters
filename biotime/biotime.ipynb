    "- [BioTIME](https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/) is a _\"global database of assemblage time series for quantifying and understanding biodiversity change\"_. Indeed, it claims to be _\"the largest compilation of biodiversity time series containing raw data on species identities and abundances from ecological assemblages\"_ ([see here](https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/downloads/interactBioTIME.html#using-the-mysql-database)).\n",
    "- Unlike the [LPI database](https://www.livingplanetindex.org/), this one does not seem to be linked to a particular indicator/index. The database seems to be cited by the community, but I'm not sure of _how_ it's actually been used by scientists (and maybe policy-makers?). The intention behind this exploration is to uncover some of the opportunities this data offers. Because we just explored the LPI data, and both should technically be compilations of \"abundance\" data<sup>(*)</sup>, we might be able to offer some comparison as well.\n",

There are 265 BioTIME consortium members based at institutions spanning 35 countries around the globe. \n",
    "- While I cannot seem to find a list of Consortium associates, the database contains a `contacts` table with details of who is behind each study, which I believe should correspond to folks who actually contributed data. Data contributors where invited to be co-authors of the [BioTIME data paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.12729). There seems to be a positive emphasis on giving credit to data collectors, which reflects on the data use agreement. \n",
    "- Submission of contributions is managed via a quite extensive `xlsx` form (link available [here](https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/contribute.php)). In the database, there's also a `curation` table which provide space for further annotations, e.g., the date of when the study was added to the database -- a thing we could not know in the LPI data. Similarly to the LPI data, though, at first glance it looks like the data is sourced from scientific literature only."
