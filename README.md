# DSE _Data Love Letters_

_Data Love Letters_ are a way for us to record and communicate the datasets, tools and communities that we explore. 

We see them as a tool for our team to transfer workflows for data-accessing, communicating dead-ends and pitfalls, 
as well as lessons learned while investigating something new.

### Repository structure

As each exploration will likely require specific tools and libraries, we organize this repo as a collection of self-contained directories. 
Every directory should ideally include details on how to reproduce the computing environment and the required data download procedures.
If not already hosted somewhere else, a quickstart Jupyter notebook (or a Binder!) should be included to ease and jumpstart our future work.

### Exploration guidelines
